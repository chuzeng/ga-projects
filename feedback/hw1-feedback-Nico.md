**Overall:**
Great work on this assignment! I only put a few notes below. I encourage you to keep practicing your Python skills and make sure you review some more fundamentals of math/stats!

**Some notes**  
* I noticed that you put all of your text answers into the code blocks. You can actually write text a bit more comfortably by taking advantage of "Markdown" in the cells of a notebook! [See this guide for more.](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)
* Note that we also might be concerned with _missing_ or _erroneous_ data. How would we deal with values that seem to be missing or improperly stored/tracked?
